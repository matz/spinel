/* builtin_ops.h -- builtin methods as data, read by inference and codegen.

   A row says what a builtin call on a receiver of one TyKind answers and
   how codegen emits it. Inference reads the result kind; codegen reads the
   emitter id and runs the emitter codegen_ops.c keeps for it. One row
   replaces the matching rule in infer_call_inner and the matching arm in
   emit_call_body, which today each decide the same call separately (#7100).

   A family's lookup sits where that family's legacy branch sat in each
   chain, so everything an earlier branch claims still goes there; it moves
   up only once nothing earlier can match the same call. */
